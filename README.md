# WiPy

WiPy is a web app that turns your computer into a local storage repository that other devices can connect to and
download files from, locally. This means that you can use WiPi to share files with other devices on the same local
network, without the need for an internet connection.

To use WiPi, simply download and install the app on your computer. Once installed, the app will create a local storage
repository on your computer. You can then add files and folders to your WiPi repository by dragging and dropping them
into the app window.

To connect to your WiPy repository from another device on the same local network, simply open a web browser on that
device and enter the URL of your computer. You can then browse your WiPy repository and download any files or folders
you need.

# Your files will need to be in a folder called 'Container' in you computer's desktop folder
